    *  Here we also introduce some about the environment variables (ev).
    *  ev mostly refers to some parameters in the operation system running environment. In mac system, we
    *  input "env" will list the current environment variables.
    *
    *  in node.js we usually do that:
    *  NODE_ENV = test node app
    *
    *  here we indicate the NOD_ENV environment variable value is test, and we can get the value of environment variable by
    *  process.env
    *  console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV) // test
    *
    *  or we also can use: cross-env
    *
    *  npm i cross-env -g
    *  cross-env NODE_ENV = test node app
    *
